    "# PyMADREQ development story and ideas\n",
    "Here, I do things as I progress in the development of PyMADREQ. The current goal is to have a package that solves multicomponent single and two phase flow (advection-diffusion) with a sequential reactive solver. I will implement some of my old ideas for creating robust solvers for two phase flow data analysis (viz. core flooding tests)."
